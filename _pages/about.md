About Me
======
I am interested in learning more about human disorders through my work at the interface of molecular pathology, clinical genomics, and translational research. As our understanding grows, my overarching goal is to translate this knowledge into developing personalized and equitable therapeutic approaches that improve patient outcomes.


Clinical Genomics
------
Molecular Profiling and classification
   - Optimize treatments
   - Prognostic and predictive gene signatures
